        "a": "The right answer is (c). Friction won't be the primary reason for the chaotic behaviour. Infact, we are assuming friction in the system is negligible.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). Air resistance is considered negligible and won't be the primary reason.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). The primary reason for the chaotic behavior of a double pendulum lies in the nonlinearity of its equations of motion. Unlike simple systems with linear behavior, the double pendulumâ€™s coupled differential equations lead to intricate, unpredictable trajectories.",
