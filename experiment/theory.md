A double pendulum system as shown in Fig 1, consists of two-point masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> suspended by strings of length l<sub>1</sub> and l<sub>2</sub> as shown below. Let the system vibrates in vertical plane with small amplitudes, under which conditions the masses may be considered to have only horizontal motion. Let θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub> be the angles the strings at any instant make with vertical and let x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> be the horizontal displacements of the two masses, such that the following relationships holds good for small amplitudes.

The above equation is quadratic in &omega;<sup>2</sup> and gives two values of &omega;<sup>2</sup>, and therefore two positive values of &omega; corresponding to two natural frequencies &omega;<sub>n1</sub> and &omega;<sub>n2</sub> of the system. The above equation is called the frequency equation since the roots of this equation gives the natural frequencies of the system.

If in either of the equations, on substituting for &omega; the value of &omega;<sub>n1</sub>, we have the first mode shape of the system i.e., when the system is vibrating with the first natural frequency &omega;<sub>n1</sub>, the mode shape is such that the ratio of the amplitude of two masses is equal to the solution of above equation.

Similarly, in either of the equations, substituting for &omega; the value of &omega;<sub>n2</sub>, we have the second mode shape of the system i.e., when the system is vibrating with the second natural frequency &omega;<sub>n2</sub>, the mode shape is such that the ratio of the amplitude of two masses is equal to the solution of above equation.

Where &mu; = 1 + (m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>), $\ddot θ1$ and $\ddot θ2$ are angular accelerations of point masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> and $\dot θ1$ and $\dot θ2$ are angular velocities of point masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>.

To solve the equation of motion for the angles, we can use the Euler method. For using Euler method, we should define a time interval and iterate over time. As time changes, angular acceleration, angular velocity and angle is changed. So, from the values of angular acceleration, velocity and angle at that instant of time, we can calculate the position of the system precisely.
